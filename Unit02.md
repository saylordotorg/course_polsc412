**Unit 2: Power, Politics, and International Law** <span id="2"></span> 
*The preeminent modern theorist of international relations, Hans
Morganthau (1978), wrote: “In the modern world, nations active in
international politics are continuously preparing for, actively involved
in, or recovering from organized violence in the form of
war.” [**[1]**](#_ftn1) One overriding theme that recurs throughout
historical consideration of the laws of war is that of reality versus
morality.  Legal realists in international affairs see the world in
terms of power struggles and national interests, rather than through the
more pure prisms of ethics, law, morality, and
ideology. [**[2]**](#_ftn2) Legal and political realists contend that
human behavior is motivated by three factors: fear, self-interest, and
honor. [**[3]**](#_ftn3)*

**2.1 The United Nations** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*In the final year of World War II, the leaders of the United States and
U.S.S.R. met at Yalta and signed an agreement relating to the release of
prisoners of war and the treatment of civilians in the former Axis and
Axis-occupied territories; the agreement came to be known as “The Yalta
Accord” (1945).  The short-term provisions of the accord required the
United States and U.S.S.R. to provide food, shelter, clothing, and
transportation (if necessary) to detainees’ and relocated civilians’
points of origin.  The accord also set the terms for the initial meeting
of the United Nations in New York.*  
  
 *Under the long-term previsions of the Yalta Accord, the Soviet Union
occupied much of Eastern Europe for over four decades.  Contemporary
critics of the Yalta Accord assert that the agreement was unjust and
subjugated millions to totalitarian rule.*  
  
 *The United Nations (UN) began with a General Assembly, which held
meetings at which representatives of all member nations were guaranteed
a “say” and vote in matters before the body and the UN Security
Council.  The UN Security Council has 15 members. Ten of the members are
countries that rotate in to sit on the council, whereas the five
preeminent nuclear powers (United States, Russia, China, France, and the
United Kingdom) are given both permanent seats on the council and the
authority to veto or block any action or vote that comes before the UN
Security Council for action.*
