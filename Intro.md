In this course, you will learn fundamental principles of international
law and examine the historical development of these laws. The nature of
international law differs in many respects from local, state, and
federal law. International laws are formed by either customary
international norms or by treaty or multilateral agreements by
organizations like the United Nations. Within the community of nations,
regional alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
may also enter into agreements for collective security that have the
force of law. The body of international law today includes treaties and
conventions, as well as rules governing diplomatic relationships between
countries. For example, the legal immunity extended to diplomats serving
in other countries is considered a part of international law. Some
critics do not consider what is termed “international law” to be law at
all, as, unlike domestic law (where there is a police force and a
judicial system to manage those who break the law), it does not have a
world government to require compliance. A state wishing to break its
treaty commitments can do so. It may risk its reputation as a good
global citizen and face international condemnation and/or possible
sanctions, but it will not, for example, be invaded by a global police
force. In spite of these challenges, international law has gained
momentum in the last 50 years in large part due to the United Nations,
which has served as a depository for an increasing number of treaties
and conventions and the recent creation of various international courts
designed specifically for dispute settlement. The first half of this
course will define international law, identify its foundations, and
review its historical development. In addition to learning how
international law has developed, we will examine how these laws are
enforced— or, in many cases, not enforced. The primary critique of
international law is that these “laws” are more aspirational than legal
due to the difficulty of enforcement. Who can enforce international law
and how are recurrent problems handled in this field? The inherent
conflicts of international law with national sovereignty, domestic
politics, and balance of power will also be reviewed. In the second half
of the course, we will explore specific topics within international law,
such as the laws of war, the laws of the sea, international human
rights, international crimes, environmental law, protection of
intellectual property, and international trade. The course will conclude
with a review of successes and failures of international law.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC412.  Below, please find general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Dr. Sharon Jumper

**Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following:

-   [The United Nations Audiovisual Library of International
    Law](http://www.un.org/law/avl/)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, which explain the foundation
for International Law and difficulties with enforcing it.  

You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  In order to “pass” this
course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your
score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you
do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of 90 hours to
complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you
plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take you 14 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on
Monday night, subunit 1.2 (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday and Wednesday
night, etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Reading about the law and jurisprudence can be
difficult at first.  The writing is often complex and legal jargon may
be unfamiliar to you.  Take your time in Units 1 and 2 so that you have
a firm understanding of the foundation of international law before
proceeding to subsequent units where specific types of legal issues are
explored in depth.
