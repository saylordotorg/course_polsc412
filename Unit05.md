**5.1 The Development and Enforcement of International Criminal Law**
<span id="5.1"></span> 
*International Criminal Law really began with World War II.  Following
the Allies’ victory, ad hoc tribunals were set up in Nuremburg and
elsewhere to try individuals charged with war crimes, genocide, and
crimes against humanity.  Codification of international laws pertaining
to war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity commenced
thereafter.  Allegations of such crimes were generally handled by
domestic courts, truth commissions, or ad hoc tribunals created by the
United Nations.*  
    
 *In 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was created.  It only
has jurisdiction over states that have ratified the ICC Convention and
the citizens of these states.  It does not have jurisdiction over China,
Russia, the United States, or the citizens thereof, as each of these
countries has refused to ratify the ICC due to concerns over national
sovereignty.*
