**1.2 Development of International Law** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*The earliest forms of international law involved trade and war. As
nation-states evolved, legal norms developed within them that led to
systemic preconditions for declarations of war.  Beginning with the
Greek city-states in the 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C.E., strategic
warfare began to evolve in Western civilization, spurring debates
between utilitarian and humanitarian leaders as to how war should be
conducted and what, if any, limits should be placed on military conduct
during operations.  As commerce and military conquests became more
frequent, alliances and treaties were formed.*
